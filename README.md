# tls-oldversions-deprecate

A draft to deprecate tlsv1.0 and tlsv1.1 initiated by Kathleen Moriarty,
assisted by sftcd, now adopted by the TLS WG. Version 10 of the draft is
(what we think is) the result of IETF last call, and will hopefully be
approved by the IESG in due course.

The latest WG draft is [here](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tls-oldversions-deprecate).

Please submit any PRs on the 
[XML file](https://github.com/tlswg/oldversions-deprecate/blob/master/draft-ietf-tls-oldversions-deprecate.xml)
- we're still using xml2rfc for this with the XML file as the source.

The last pre-WG version was
[draft-moriarty-tls-oldversions-diediedie-01.txt](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-moriarty-tls-oldversions-diediedie-01)
and was in [this repo](https://github.com/sftcd/tls-oldversions-diediedie).

Additionally:

- A presentation on this from [IETF-103](https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/103/materials/slides-103-tls-sessa-ietf-103-deprecate-old-tls-versions-00)
- A [script](./nonobsnorms.sh) to retrieve the set of RFCs that normatively refer
  to TLS1.0 or TLS1.1 (93 exist) and that are not obsoleted (76 exist). The
  output of that is [here](./nonobsnorms.out). That script will also produce
  snippets of XML for inclusion in your base draft - see the code for 
  details.
