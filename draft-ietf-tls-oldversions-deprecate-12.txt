Abstract

   This document, if approved, formally deprecates Transport Layer
   Security (TLS) versions 1.0 (RFC 2246) and 1.1 (RFC 4346).
   Accordingly, those documents (will be moved|have been moved) to
   Historic status.  These versions lack support for current and
   recommended cryptographic algorithms and mechanisms, and various
   government and industry profiles of applications using TLS now
   mandate avoiding these old TLS versions.  TLSv1.2 became the
   recommended version for IETF protocols in 2008, (subsequently being
   obsoleted by TLSv1.3 in 2018), providing sufficient time to
   transition away from older versions.  Removing support for older
   versions from implementations reduces the attack surface, reduces
   opportunity for misconfiguration, and streamlines library and product
   maintenance.

   This document also deprecates Datagram TLS (DTLS) version 1.0 (RFC
   4347), but not DTLS version 1.2, and there is no DTLS version 1.1.

   This document updates many RFCs that normatively refer to TLSv1.0 or
   TLSv1.1 as described herein.  This document also updates the best
   practices for TLS usage in RFC 7525 and hence is part of BCP 195.

1.  Introduction

   Transport Layer Security (TLS) versions 1.0 [RFC2246] and 1.1
   [RFC4346] were superseded by TLSv1.2 [RFC5246] in 2008, which has now
   itself been superseded by TLSv1.3 [RFC8446].  Datagram Transport
   Layer Security (DTLS) version 1.0 [RFC4347] was superseded by
   DTLSv1.2 [RFC6347] in 2012.  It is therefore timely to further
   deprecate TLSv1.0, TLSv1.1 and DTLSv1.0.  Accordingly, those
   documents (will be moved|have been moved) to Historic status.

   Technical reasons for deprecating these versions include:

   o  They require implementation of older cipher suites that are no
      longer desirable for cryptographic reasons, e.g., TLSv1.0 makes
      TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA mandatory to implement
   o  Lack of support for current recommended cipher suites, especially
      AEAD ciphers which are not supported prior to TLSv1.2.  Note:
      registry entries for no-longer-desirable ciphersuites remain in
      the registries, but many TLS registries are being updated through
      [RFC8447] which indicates that such entries are not recommended by
      the IETF.
   o  Integrity of the handshake depends on SHA-1 hash.
   o  Authentication of the peers depends on SHA-1 signatures.
   o  Support for four TLS protocol versions increases the likelihood of
      misconfiguration.
   o  At least one widely-used library has plans to drop TLSv1.1 and
      TLSv1.0 support in upcoming releases; products using such
      libraries would need to use older versions of the libraries to
      support TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1, which is clearly undesirable.

   Deprecation of these versions is intended to assist developers as
   additional justification to no longer support older (D)TLS versions
   and to migrate to a minimum of (D)TLSv1.2.  Deprecation also assists
   product teams with phasing out support for the older versions, to
   reduce the attack surface and the scope of maintenance for protocols
   in their offerings.

1.1.  RFCs Updated

   This document updates the following RFCs that normatively reference
   TLSv1.0 or TLSv1.1 or DTLS1.0.  The update is to obsolete usage of
   these older versions.  Fallback to these versions is prohibited
   through this update.  Specific references to mandatory minimum
   protocol versions of TLSv1.0 or TLSv1.1 are replaced by TLSv1.2, and

   references to minimum protocol version DTLSv1.0 are replaced by
   DTLSv1.2.  Statements that "TLSv1.0 is the most widely deployed
   version and will provide the broadest interoperability" are removed
   without replacement.

   and [RFC3656] will be updated with permission of the Independent
   Stream Editor.

   In addition these RFCs normatively refer to TLSv1.0 or TLSv1.1 and
   have already been obsoleted; they are still listed here and marked as
   updated by this document in order to reiterate that any usage of the
   obsolete protocol should still use modern TLS: [RFC5953] [RFC5101]
   [RFC5081] [RFC5077] [RFC4934] [RFC4572] [RFC4507] [RFC4492] [RFC4366]
   [RFC4347] [RFC4244] [RFC4132] [RFC3920] [RFC3734] [RFC3588] [RFC3546]
   [RFC3489] [RFC3316]

   Note that [RFC4642] has already been updated by [RFC8143], which
   makes an overlapping, but not quite identical, update as this
   document.

   [RFC6614] has a requirement for TLSv1.1 or later, although only makes
   an informative reference to [RFC4346].  This requirement is updated
   to be for TLSv1.2 or later.

   [RFC6460], [RFC4744], and [RFC4743] are already Historic; they are
   still listed here and marked as updated by this document in order to
   reiterate that any usage of the obsolete protocol should still use
   modern TLS.

   This document updates DTLS [RFC6347].  [RFC6347] had allowed for
   negotiating the use of DTLSv1.0, which is now forbidden.

   The DES and IDEA cipher suites specified in [RFC5469] were
   specifically removed from TLSv1.2 by [RFC5246]; since the only

   versions of TLS for which their usage is defined are now Historic,
   RFC 5469 (will be|has been) moved to Historic as well.

   The version-fallback Signaling Cipher Suite Value specified in
   [RFC7507] was defined to detect when a given client and server
   negotiate a lower version of (D)TLS than their highest shared
   version.  TLSv1.3 ([RFC8446]) incorporates a different mechanism that
   achieves this purpose, via sentinel values in the ServerHello.Random
   field.  With (D)TLS versions prior to 1.2 fully deprecated, the only
   way for (D)TLS implementations to negotiate a lower version than
   their highest shared version would be to negotiate (D)TLSv1.2 while
   supporting (D)TLSv1.3; supporting (D)TLSv1.3 implies support for the
   ServerHello.Random mechanism.  Accordingly, the functionality from
   [RFC7507] has been superseded, and this document marks it as
   Obsolete.

1.2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Support for Deprecation

   Specific details on attacks against TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1, as well as
   their mitigations, are provided in [NIST800-52r2], RFC 7457 [RFC7457]
   and other RFCs referenced therein.  Although mitigations for the
   current known vulnerabilities have been developed, any future issues
   discovered in old protocol versions might not be mitigated in older
   library versions when newer library versions do not support those old
   protocols.

   NIST for example has provided the following rationale, copied with
   permission from [NIST800-52r2], section 1.2 "History of TLS" (with
   references changed for RFC formatting).

      TLS 1.1, specified in [RFC4346], was developed to address
      weaknesses discovered in TLS 1.0, primarily in the areas of
      initialization vector selection and padding error processing.
      Initialization vectors were made explicit to prevent a certain
      class of attacks on the Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode of
      operation used by TLS.  The handling of padding errors was altered
      to treat a padding error as a bad message authentication code,
      rather than a decryption failure.  In addition, the TLS 1.1 RFC
      acknowledges attacks on CBC mode that rely on the time to compute
      the message authentication code (MAC).  The TLS 1.1 specification



Moriarty & Farrell        Expires July 25, 2021                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft       Deprecating TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1        January 2021


      states that to defend against such attacks, an implementation must
      process records in the same manner regardless of whether padding
      errors exist.  Further implementation considerations for CBC modes
      (which were not included in RFC4346 [RFC4346]) are discussed in
      Section 3.3.2.

      TLSv1.2, specified in RFC5246 [RFC5246], made several
      cryptographic enhancements, particularly in the area of hash
      functions, with the ability to use or specify the SHA-2 family
      algorithms for hash, MAC, and Pseudorandom Function (PRF)
      computations.  TLSv1.2 also adds authenticated encryption with
      associated data (AEAD) cipher suites.

      TLSv1.3, specified in TLSv1.3 [RFC8446], represents a significant
      change to TLS that aims to address threats that have arisen over
      the years.  Among the changes are a new handshake protocol, a new
      key derivation process that uses the HMAC-based Extract-and-Expand
      Key Derivation Function (HKDF), and the removal of cipher suites
      that use static RSA or DH key exchanges, the CBC mode of
      operation, or SHA-1.  The list of extensions that can be used with
      TLSv1.3 has been reduced considerably.

3.  SHA-1 Usage Problematic in TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1

   The integrity of both TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1 depends on a running SHA-1
   hash of the exchanged messages.  This makes it possible to perform a
   downgrade attack on the handshake by an attacker able to perform 2^77
   operations, well below the acceptable modern security margin.

   Similarly, the authentication of the handshake depends on signatures
   made using a SHA-1 hash or a not appreciably stronger concatenation
   of MD-5 and SHA-1 hashes, allowing the attacker to impersonate a
   server when it is able to break the severely weakened SHA-1 hash.

   Neither TLSv1.0 nor TLSv1.1 allow the peers to select a stronger hash
   for signatures in the ServerKeyExchange or CertificateVerify
   messages, making the only upgrade path the use of a newer protocol
   version.

   See [Bhargavan2016] for additional detail.

4.  Do Not Use TLSv1.0

   TLSv1.0 MUST NOT be used.  Negotiation of TLSv1.0 from any version of
   TLS MUST NOT be permitted.

Internet-Draft       Deprecating TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1        January 2021


   Any other version of TLS is more secure than TLSv1.0.  While TLSv1.0
   can be configured to prevent some types of interception, using the
   highest version available is preferred.

   Pragmatically, clients MUST NOT send a ClientHello with
   ClientHello.client_version set to {03,01}. Similarly, servers MUST
   NOT send a ServerHello with ServerHello.server_version set to
   {03,01}. Any party receiving a Hello message with the protocol
   version set to {03,01} MUST respond with a "protocol_version" alert
   message and close the connection.

   Historically, TLS specifications were not clear on what the record
   layer version number (TLSPlaintext.version) could contain when
   sending ClientHello.  Appendix E of [RFC5246] notes that
   TLSPlaintext.version could be selected to maximize interoperability,
   though no definitive value is identified as ideal.  That guidance is
   still applicable; therefore, TLS servers MUST accept any value
   {03,XX} (including {03,00}) as the record layer version number for
   ClientHello, but they MUST NOT negotiate TLSv1.0.

5.  Do Not Use TLSv1.1

   TLSv1.1 MUST NOT be used.  Negotiation of TLSv1.1 from any version of
   TLS MUST NOT be permitted.

   Pragmatically, clients MUST NOT send a ClientHello with
   ClientHello.client_version set to {03,02}. Similarly, servers MUST
   NOT send a ServerHello with ServerHello.server_version set to
   {03,02}. Any party receiving a Hello message with the protocol
   version set to {03,02} MUST respond with a "protocol_version" alert
   message and close the connection.

   Any newer version of TLS is more secure than TLSv1.1.  While TLSv1.1
   can be configured to prevent some types of interception, using the
   highest version available is preferred.  Support for TLSv1.1 is
   dwindling in libraries and will impact security going forward if
   mitigations for attacks cannot be easily addressed and supported in
   older libraries.

   Historically, TLS specifications were not clear on what the record
   layer version number (TLSPlaintext.version) could contain when
   sending ClientHello.  Appendix E of [RFC5246] notes that
   TLSPlaintext.version could be selected to maximize interoperability,
   though no definitive value is identified as ideal.  That guidance is
   still applicable; therefore, TLS servers MUST accept any value
   {03,XX} (including {03,00}) as the record layer version number for
   ClientHello, but they MUST NOT negotiate TLSv1.1.

6.  Updates to RFC 7525

   RFC7525 is BCP 195, "Recommendations for Secure Use of Transport
   Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)",
   which is the most recent best practice document for implementing TLS
   and was based on TLSv1.2.  At the time of publication, TLSv1.0 and
   TLSv1.1 had not yet been deprecated.  As such, BCP 195 is called out
   specifically to update text implementing the deprecation
   recommendations of this document.

   This document updates [RFC7525] Section 3.1.1 changing SHOULD NOT to
   MUST NOT as follows:

   o  Implementations MUST NOT negotiate TLS version 1.0 [RFC2246].

      Rationale: TLSv1.0 (published in 1999) does not support many
      modern, strong cipher suites.  In addition, TLSv1.0 lacks a per-
      record Initialization Vector (IV) for CBC-based cipher suites and
      does not warn against common padding errors.

   o  Implementations MUST NOT negotiate TLS version 1.1 [RFC4346].

      Rationale: TLSv1.1 (published in 2006) is a security improvement
      over TLSv1.0 but still does not support certain stronger cipher
      suites.

   This documents updates [RFC7525] Section 3.1.2 changing SHOULD NOT to
   MUST NOT as follows:

   o  Implementations MUST NOT negotiate DTLS version 1.0 [RFC4347],
      [RFC6347].

      Version 1.0 of DTLS correlates to version 1.1 of TLS (see above).

7.  Operational Considerations

   This document is part of BCP 195, and as such reflects the
   understanding of the IETF (at the time of its publication) as to the
   best practices for TLS and DTLS usage.

   Though TLSv1.1 has been obsolete since the publication of RFC 5246 in
   2008, and DTLSv1.0 has been obsolete since the publication of RFC
   6347 in 2012, there may remain some systems in operation that do not
   support (D)TLSv1.2 or higher.  Adopting the practices recommended by
   this document for any systems that need to communicate with the
   aforementioned class of systems will cause failure to interoperate.
   However, disregarding the recommendations of this document in order
   to continue to interoperate with the aforementioned class of systems

Internet-Draft       Deprecating TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1        January 2021


   incurs some amount of risk.  The nature of the risks incurred by
   operating in contravention to the recommendations of this document
   are discussed in Sections 2 and 3, and knowledge of those risks
   should be used along with any potential mitigating factors and the
   risks inherent to updating the systems in question when deciding how
   quickly to adopt the recommendations specified in this document.

8.  Security Considerations

   This document deprecates two older TLS protocol versions and one
   older DTLS protocol version for security reasons already described.
   The attack surface is reduced when there are a smaller number of
   supported protocols and fallback options are removed.

Internet-Draft       Deprecating TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1        January 2021


Appendix A.  Change Log

   [[RFC editor: please remove this before publication.]]

   From draft-ietf-tls-oldversions-deprecate-11 to draft-ietf-tls-
   oldversions-deprecate-12 (IESG review):

   o  Minor edits from IESG review comments.

   From draft-ietf-tls-oldversions-deprecate-10 to draft-ietf-tls-
   oldversions-deprecate-11:

   o  RFC 5953 was mentioned in the wrong para of section 1.1 - it has
      been obsoleted already.

   From draft-ietf-tls-oldversions-deprecate-09 to draft-ietf-tls-
   oldversions-deprecate-10:

   o  We missed adding change logs for a few versions, but since -09 was
      the one that underwent IETF last call, and there was some
      discussion, we figured it'd be good to mention substantive changes
      here.
   o  Added Ben's suggested text for "operational considerations"
      following extensive last call discussion.
   o  Re-checked the references to RFC 4347 after Tom Petch noticed we
      missed a couple.  Added RFCs 5953 and 6353 to the list here.  All
      others were in already.
   o  Fixed various typos and ack'd those who engaged a bit in the IETF
      LC discussion.  (If we missed you and you want to be added, or if
      you'd rather not be mentioned, just ping the authors.)

   From draft-ietf-tls-oldversions-deprecate-05 to draft-ietf-tls-
   oldversions-deprecate-06:

   o  Fixed "yaleman" ack.
   o  Added RFC6614 to UPDATEs list.
   o  per preliminary AD review:

      *  Remove references from abstract
      *  s/primary technical reasons/technical reasons/
      *  Add rfc7030 to 1.1
      *  verified that all the RFCs in the (massive:-) Updates meta-data
         are mentioned in section 1.1 (I think appropriately;-)

   From draft-ietf-tls-oldversions-deprecate-04 to draft-ietf-tls-
   oldversions-deprecate-05:

Internet-Draft       Deprecating TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1        January 2021


   o  Removed references to goverment related deprecation statements:
      US, Canada, and Germany.  NIST documentation rationale remains as
      a reference describing the relevent RFCs and justification.

   From draft-ietf-tls-oldversions-deprecate-02 to draft-ietf-tls-
   oldversions-deprecate-03:

   o  Added 8261 to updates list based on IETF-104 meeting.

   From draft-ietf-tls-oldversions-deprecate-01 to draft-ietf-tls-
   oldversions-deprecate-02:

   o  Correction: 2nd list of referenced RFCs in Section 1.1 aren't
      informatively refering to tls1.0/1.1
   o  Remove RFC7255 from updates list - datatracker has bad data
      (spotted by Robert Sparks)
   o  Added point about RFCs 8143 and 4642
   o  Added UPDATEs for RFCs that refer to 4347 and aren't OBSOLETEd
   o  Added note about RFC8261 to see what WG want.

   From draft-ietf-tls-oldversions-deprecate-00 to draft-ietf-tls-
   oldversions-deprecate-01:

   o  PRs with typos and similar: so far just #1
   o  PR#2 noting msft browser announced deprecation (but this was OBE
      as per...)
   o  Implemented actions as per IETF-103 meeting:

      *  Details about which RFC's, BCP's are affected were generated
         using a script in the git repo: https://github.com/tlswg/
         oldversions-deprecate/blob/master/nonobsnorms.sh
      *  Removed the 'measurements' part
      *  Removed SHA-1 deprecation (section 8 of -00)

   From draft-moriarty-tls-oldversions-diediedie-01 to draft-ietf-tls-
   oldversions-deprecate-00:

   o  I-Ds became RFCs 8446/8447 (old-repo PR#4, for TLSv1.3)
   o  Accepted old-repo PR#5 fixing typos

   From draft-moriarty-tls-oldversions-diediedie-00 to draft-moriarty-
   tls-oldversions-diediedie-01:

   o  Added stats sent to list so far
   o  PR's #2,3
   o  a few more references
   o  added section on email
